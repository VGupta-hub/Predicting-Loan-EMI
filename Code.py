# Let's understand this program with a simple example.

# Sarah is planning to buy a house that costs $1,260,000. She considering two options to finance her purchase:
#   Option 1: Make an immediate down payment of $300,000, and take loan 8-year loan with an interest rate of 10% per annum (compounded monthly) for the remaining amount.
#   Option 2: Take a 10-year loan with an interest rate of 8% per annum (compounded monthly) for the entire amount. Both these loans have to be paid back in equal monthly 
#             installments (EMIs). Which loan has a lower EMI among the two?
# Since we need to compare the EMIs for two loan options, defining a function to calculate the EMI for a loan would be a great idea. 
# The inputs to the function would be cost of the house, the down payment, duration of the loan, rate of interest etc.

# We'll build this function step by step.

def loan_emi(amount):
    emi = amount//12
    print("The EMI is ${}.".format(emi))
    
loan_emi(1260000)

Output: The emi is $105000.
  
# Lets now add a second argument which is the duration of the loan.
def loan_emi(amount, duration):
    emi = amount//duration
    print("The EMI is ${}.".format(emi))

loan_emi(1260000,10*12)

Output : The emi is $10500.
  
# Return Values : It is used to return and store the result in variables for easier comparision. This is done using the return statement.

def loan_emi(amount, duration):
    emi = amount//duration
    return emi
 
emi_1 = loan_emi(75000,6*12)
emi_2 = loan_emi(36000,6*12)
emi_3 = loan_emi(55000,6*12)

# Now let's add the downpayment into our function. We can make it as a optional argument by giving it a value of 0.

def loan_emi(amount, duration, down_payment = 0):
    loan_amount = amount - down_payment
    emi = loan_amount//duration
    return emi
  
emi_1 = 625
emi_2 = 361
emi_3 = 763

# Now let's add the interest calculation into the function. Interest is calculated as (Pr(1+n)^n)/((1+r)^n-1).

def loan_emi(amount, duration, rate, down_payment = 0):
    loan_amount = amount - down_payment
    emi = loan_amount*rate*((1+rate)**duration)//(((1+rate)**duration)-1)
    return emi
  
emi_1 = loan_emi(1260000,8*12,0.1/12,300000) # Considering a down payment of $300000
Output = 14567.0

emi_2 = loan_emi(1260000,10*12,0.08/12) #considering $0 downpayment
Output = 15287.0
